    # Details:
    #   Copper Pieces are called Thumbs in Cormyr, Fandars in Amn, Unarches in Calimport, Nibs in Waterdeep, Thalvers in Cormanthyr and Bits in Southern Lands. Sembia does not use Copper Pieceage (but they do use copper trade bars), but the cp's place in the economy is taken up by a square iron coin called a Steelpence.
