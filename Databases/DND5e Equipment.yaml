    Category: Adventuring Gear
    Cost: 5gp
    Weight: 25lb
    Rarity: Common
    Description: When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed
      steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the
      center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as
      a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate
      must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and
      stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement
      is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can
      use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
      within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to
      the trapped creature.
