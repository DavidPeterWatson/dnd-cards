  Rage:
    Type: Capability
    Properties:
      Duration: 1min
    Description: |
      Bonus action on your turn: enter a rage.
      Add Rage Damage to damage roll when attacking with melee weapon.
      Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing (halve damage).
    Details: |
      While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
      You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
      When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
      You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
      If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

      Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

      Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
