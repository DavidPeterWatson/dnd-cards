    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 2 
    Chapter: Phandalin
    Encounter: Overview
    Description: |
      For DM
      The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same ore horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.
      In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.
    Details: |
      The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.
      As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

  2.1 Enter Phandalin:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:
        Sildar seems much more at ease.
        My friends,” he says, "let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint.”


      Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, larno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the “Townmaster's Hall” section). up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the “Townmaster's Hall” section).
      During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the “Town Description”section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.

  2.1.1 Enter Phandalin w Sildar Hallwinter:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the “Town Description”section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.
      Some locales the characters should visit include the following:
      - Barthen's Provisions. If the characters have the wagon load of supplies from the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.
      - Lionshield Coster. If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.
      - Stonehill Inn. If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.

  2.2 Encounters in Phandalin:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Encounters in Phandalin
      When the characters explore Phandalin, you don't need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you're directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.
      To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, “There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?” When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.

  2.2.1 Stonehill Inn:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The Stonehill Inn, If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are “pointers” who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.

  2.2.2 Redbrand Ruffians:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Redbrand Ruffians sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the “Redbrand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.

  2.2.3 Finding Cragmaw Castle:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Finding Cragmaw Castle. The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands. and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.

  2.0.3 Roleplaying Phandalin NPCs:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If you're not sure how to run an NPC, a good way to start is to have the character introduce himself or herself, welcome the adventurers to Phandalin, and ask who they are and what they want. You don't need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here's some advice:
      • Relax. Don't worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).
      • Get inside the NPCs' minds. Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.
      • Mug it up. Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together—what- ever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.
      • Try different voices. Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.
      • Keep the game moving. Let the players steer the inter- actions with the NPCs.

  2.0.3 Town Description:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Town Description
      Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you'll have to take turns running
      each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter potentially more dangerous.
      The following sections detail specific locations in town.

  2.2.1.1 Stonehill Inn:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      ""In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.""

      This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see “Food, Drink, and Lodging” in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)
      The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered
      a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.
      Rumors. 
      Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include:
      • Narth, an old farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.” (See the “Shrine of Luck” section for more information.)
      • Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.” (See the “Edermath Orchard” section for more information.)
      • Lanar, a miner: “Ore raiders have been seen on the
      east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.” (See the “Townmaster's Hall” section for more information.)
      • Trilena, the innkeeper's wife: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too.” (Unknown  to Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took
      Thel's wife and children to their secret hideout.)
      • Pip, Toblen's young son: “Qelline Alderleafs son
      Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.” (See the “Alderleaf Farm” section for more information.)
      • Freda, a weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange. They don't want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.” (See the “Phandalin Miner's Exchange” section for more information.)

      These leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town—and that the ruffians are trouble.

  2.2.4 Barthen's Provisions:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Barthen's is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see “Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directedtotheLionshieldCoster(seethatsection).
      The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn't around.
      DeliveringtheSupplies. Ifthecharactersbeganplay with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen's. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If
      the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn't already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the “Background” section at the start of the adventure.
      Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return “any day now” to resupply. What Barthen doesn't know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See part 4, the “Wave Echo Cave” section, for more information.
      Barthen fs News. If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters seem of a mind to do something about
      it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.


  2.3.0 Edermath Orchard:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.
      Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.
      Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the “Tresendar Manor” section for more information.)
      Quest:OldOwlTrouble. Daranhasheardstories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeastofPhandalin,andfindoutwho'sthereand what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see “Old Owl Well” (page 29).
      Joining the Order of the Gauntlet
      If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character agrees, Daran awards the person the title of Chevall.

  2.4.0 Lionshield Coster:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.
      This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.) 
      The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.
      In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see “Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.
      Recovered Goods. If the characters return the stolen goods found in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.

  2.5.0 Phandalin Miner's Exchange:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors. The exchange is a great place to meet people who
      spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton.
      In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.
      Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.
      Quest: Halia'sJob Offer. If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians
      loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader's quarters. Halia doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 1 5 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.

  2.6.0 Joining the Zhentarim:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Zhentarim. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim's pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of Fang.

  2.7.0 Alderleaf Farm:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      A wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is
      a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don't want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.
      Carp's Story. Qelline's son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad often years. He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of “big ugly bandits” came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with
      a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel leads to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.
      Quest: Reidoth the Druid. Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, “since there's not an inch of the land he doesn't know.” She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see “Ruins of Thundertree” (page 30).


  2.8.0 Shrine of Luck:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Phandalin's only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.
      The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele
      is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and
      covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and
      any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.
      Quest: The Banshee's Bargain. Recently, Garaele's superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her.
      Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions ofhealing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see “Conyberry and Agatha's Lair” (page 28).
      Joining the Harpers
      If the party helps Garaele learn the fate of Bowgentle's spellbook, the elf privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network
      and possess a desire to enact positive change through information and secrecy. If a character agrees, Sister Garaele awards the individual the title of Watcher.

  2.9.0 The Sleeping Giant:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      This rundown tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin's main street. It is frequented by Redbrand thugs and operated by a surly female dwarf named Grista. If the characters choose to visit the place, run the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter.

  Townmaster's Hall:

    Description: |
      ""The townmaster's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: “REWARD—Ores near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the ore menace should inquire within.” The notice bears the town's seal and an indecipherable signature.""

      Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as townmaster each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current townmaster is a male human banker named Harbin Wester—a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they're “just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really.”
      The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.
      Quest: Ore Trouble. Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of ores near Wyvern Tor. He offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. If the party pursues this quest, see “Wyvern Tor” (page 35).
      Quest: Finding Cragmaw Castle. After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster's hall. As an agent of the Lords' Alliance, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.
      Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and  defeat or drive off the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see “Wilderness Encounters” in the “Triboar Trail” section of part 3).
      Quest: Finding Iarno. After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that larno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords' Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what's left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as “a short, dark- bearded human wizard in his thirties.”
      Unknown to Sildar, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Rcdbrand threat.

  Joining the Lords' Alliance:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If the party eliminates the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno's treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Lords' Alliance. He speaks with those who exemplify a desire for the security of civilization through action. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of Cloak.


    Tresendar Manor:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout.


  Redbrand Ruffians:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Within a day or so of the adventurers' arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:
      After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.
      The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to “Redbrand Hideout.”
      If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.


  Confrontation:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      If the characters confront the Redbrands at the ^ Sleeping Giant, read:
        The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.
        One of the thugs spits on the ground. “Well, well,” he snarls. "Here's a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?”

  Confrontation:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:
      As you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.
      One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way.”
      Continue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don't. Neither side is surprised, because it's obvious that a fight is brewing.
      The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.

  Developments:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can impart useful information. (See the “What the Redbrands Know” sidebar on page 20.) Townmaster Harbin Wester won't want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated,
      but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate
      him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.
      If the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the townmaster, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn't punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.

  Awarding Experience Points for Redbrands:

      Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians.


  Do the Players Need Direction?:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      After the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter, the players should feel it's time to deal with the rest of the gang. If they aren't clear that investigating the Redbrand hideout should be their next move, have one of the NPCs they've already met in town make the suggestion directly and point them toward Tresendar Manor.
      If the players want to follow other leads in the area, it's okay to move on to part 3 of the adventure and let the ruffians wait. The next time the characters return to Phandalin, make it clear that the Redbrands are causing even more trouble, and that they need to be dealt with.



  Redbrand Hideout:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The Redbrands' base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.
      If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of area 8. Redbrand Hideout

      If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of area 8.
      General Features
      The hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.
      Ceilings. Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.
      Doors. All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. larno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.
      A locked door can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.
      Secret Doors. An “S” on the Redbrand Hideout map indicates the location of a secret door.
      Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.
      Light. Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.


  What the Redbrands Know:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of their hideout under Tresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:
      • TheleaderoftheRedbrandsisahumanwizardknownas Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only larno Albrek and the Black Spider know Glasstaff's real name.) Glasstaff's chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see areas H and 12).
      • A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area 9).
      • Thelowerpartofthecomplexisguardedbyahideous“eye monster” (see area 8).
      • TheRedbrandshaveahandfulofcaptivesinaholdingarea “near the old crypts,” which are guarded by skeletons (see areas 4 and 5).


  1. Cellar:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      Any exploration of the manor grounds finds it deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.
      When the characters open the door, read the following:
        ""The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.""
        This room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base
      of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.
      The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area 2.
      Cistern. This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.
      A waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water. It's not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items (see the “Treasure” section).
      Secret Door. A secret door is located in the southwest corner of the room. See the “General Features” section for more information on secret doors.


  Developments:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      No monsters or villains are found in this area, but the ruffians in area 2 take notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They creep into the room, gaining surprise if the characters don't hear them (see “Surprise” in the rulebook). If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.

  Treasure:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      The satchel hidden in the cistern is waterproof and contains a potion ofhealing, a potion ofinvisibility, 50
      gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that larno keeps here in case of an emergency.

  2.Barracks:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      Most of the Redbrands' human members have lodgings in Phandalin. This barracks is a good place to lie low after shaking down local miners and fur traders.

      This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.


      Three Redbrand ruffians are resting in this room. If they hearagooddealofnoiseinarea1 (includingloudvoices or barrels being rolled around), they prepare themselves for a fight and try to surprise intruders.
      The barrels here contain similar provisions to those in area 1.


  Treasure:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |

      All three Redbrands wear belt pouches holding treasure. The first holds 16 sp and 7 gp; the second, 12 sp and 5 gp; and the third, 15 ep and two garnets (10 gp each). Additionally, three dirty scarlet cloaks hang from the bunks.
