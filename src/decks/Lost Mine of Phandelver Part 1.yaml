    Description: |
      "In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found “something big,” and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of business.”
      You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail."

  1.1 Along the Route:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: 0
    Card: 1
    Description: |
      Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:
      - Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already.
      - Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player's character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure's backstory.
      - Ask the players to give you the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren's wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.

  1.1.1 The Wagon:
    Type: Prop
    # Image: Transport/Cart Horses6-5x2.png
    Back Image: Transport/Cart Horses6-5x2.png
    Description: |
      The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.

  1.1.2 Goblin Ambush:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      "You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.""

      Investigation:
      "The horses belong to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case."

      "Four goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack with stealth."

      When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks.

      Developments - Defeat
    Description: |
      In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen's Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins' trail.

    Description: |
      The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows.
      If the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:
        Goblin Knowledge

  1.1.2.2 Goblin Knowledge:
    Type: Prop
    Header: Goblin Knowledge
    Description: |
      What the Goblins Know:
      - Cragmaw Hideout was setup by Cragmaw Goblin tribe to harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail.
      - Fewer than twenty goblins currently dwell in Cragmaw Hideout.
      - Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. He answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle.
      - Cragmaw Castle lies about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.
      - Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Crol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.
      - The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf's human companion is being held in the “eating cave”.

      A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way.

  1.1.2.4 Goblin Ambush Developments - To Phandolin:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, “Phandalin.” Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen's Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.

  1.1.3 Goblin Trail:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest.

      DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) Check:
      "You recognize that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site."

      The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.
      The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout. Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.

  1.1.4 Goblin Trail Snare:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, the party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn't carefully lowered down takes ld6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.

  1.1.5 Goblin Trail Pit:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.

  1.1.6 Goblin Ambush XP:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.

  1.2.0 Cragmaw Hideout:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: 0
    Description: |
      The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.
      General Features
      - The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.
      - Ceilings. Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.
      - Light. Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.
      - Rubble. Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the rulebook).
      - Sound. The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren't listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.
      - Stalagmites. These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see “Cover” in the rulebook).
      - Stream. The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.

  1.2.1 Cave Mouth:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Cave Mouth
    Description: |
      "Following the goblins' trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense impenetrable briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream."

  1.2.1 Cave Mouth Developments:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Cave Mouth
    Description: |
      The goblins in area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here—for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, crossing the stream without stealth, and so on—the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover.

  1.2.2 Goblin Blind:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Goblin Blind
    Description: |
      When the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to area 2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.
      On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area—including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!
    Details: |
      Two goblins are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don't notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.
      Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the goblins' passive Wisdom (Perception) score to avoid being surprised. See the rulebook for more information on ability check contests.

  1.2.3 Kennel:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Kennel
    Description: |
      ""Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf's chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.""
    Details: |
      Three wolves are confined here. They can't reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the “Developments” section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other. A character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.
      
      Fissure. A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that's been discarded through  the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.

  1.2.3.1 Kennel Developments:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Kennel
    Description: |
      If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed. A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.

  1.2.4 Steep Passage:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Steep Passage
    Description: |
      From this point on, characters without darkvision will need light to see their surroundings.
      ""The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.""
      Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at area 5. Add:
      ""In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.""


      Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblins Dexterity (Stealth) check result. The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don't use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the “Flood!” section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.


      Western Passage. This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the rulebook). The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls prone on a failed save (see “Being Prone” in the rulebook).

  1.2.5 Overpass:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Overpass
    Description: |
      Where a high tunnel passes through the larger tunnel cavern below, the goblins have set up a bridge guard post.
      ""The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.""
      If the characters didn't spot the bridge while navigating area 4, they spot it now. Add:
        A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.

      One goblin stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed. If the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to release a flood (see the “Flood!” section), then throws javelins down at the characters.

      Bridge. This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It's possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.
      The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (see “Being Prone” in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.

  1.2.5.1 Flood:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Flood!
    Description: |
      The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in area 7 are signaled by the lookout in area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins' initiative count, a water surge pours from area 7 down to area 1.
      ""The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!""
    Details: |
      The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading up to area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to area 1, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage along the way. The goblins in area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don't do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.

  1.2.6 Goblin Den:
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Goblin Den
    Description: |
      The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks.
      ""This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.""
      Details: |
        Six goblins inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.


      Sildar Hallwinter, a human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point.
      The goblin leader, Yeemik, is second-in-command
      of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. “Truce, or this human dies!” he shouts.
      Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear's head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn't trust the goblin, and he's right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.  If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes ld6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see “Damage, Healing, and Dying” in the rulebook).


      Roleplaying Sildar
      Sildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly
      fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Waterdeep. He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.
      Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.
      Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:
      • The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the “Background” section to the players at this time.)
      • Ktarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to
      be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.
      • Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the “What the Goblins Know” sidebar on page 8.)
      • Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.
      Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.

    Encounter: Goblin Den
    Description: |
      If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn't have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character. If Sildar joins the party, see the “NPC Party Members” sidebar for tips on how to run him.

    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1 
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Goblin Den
    Description: |
      If the goblins have drained either pool to flood the passage, adjust the following boxed text accordingly.
      ""This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.""
    Details: |
      Three goblins guard this cave. If the goblin in area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in area 8 can't hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to area 8 to warn Klarg.
      Rock Dams.
      The goblins built simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If the goblin sentry in area 5 has called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both of the pools are mostly empty and the stream is flowing unimpeded.

  1.2.8 Klarg's Cave:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 1
    Chapter: Cragmaw Hideout
    Encounter: Klarg's Cave
    Description: |
      The leader of the goblinoids insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders' stolen goods in his den. The Cragmaws' plunder from the last month of raiding and ambushing caravans is here.
      ""Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder.""

      Klarg the bugbear shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf. Ripper, and two goblins. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person (“Who dares defy Klarg?” or “Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!”). The goblins under his command resent his bullying.

      Fire Pit. The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or ld6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.

      Natural Chimney. A niche
      in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.
      Supplies. The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion—the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin.
      Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the “Treasure” section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.

    Description: |
      If Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave.
      If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.
      If the wolf is killed, Klarg attempts to climb down the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex.

      The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, “Phandalin”), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.
      In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions ofhealing, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.

      What's Next?
      The next stage of the adventure takes place in Phandalin. The adventurers should have plenty of reasons to visit the town:
      If the characters began with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they can be paid by Barthen's Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies.
      If the characters rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the wounded warrior would appreciate an escort to Phandalin (and will pay 50 gp for the service)
      Details contained within the characters' backgrounds might prompt them to seek out specific NPCs in the town.
      It's also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure). If that's the case, skip ahead to that section.

      Exploring the Cragmaw hideout and defeating Klarg and his allies completes a story milestone. Award each character 275 XP. This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain 2nd level.
      Level advancement rules for characters are provided on loose sheets included in this set. Hand these sheets to the players, and allow them to advance their characters to 2nd level before continuing the adventure. Make sure they've recorded their XP totals on their character sheets.
      In the next part of the adventure, you'll award XP differently. The characters will earn experience points based on the monsters and traps they overcome, the NPCs they interact with, and the goals they accomplish.
      If the adventurers come up with a nonviolent way to neutralize the threat that a monster poses, award them experience points as if they had defeated it.


  2 Phandalin:
    Type: Narrative
    Campaign: Lost Mine of Phandelver
    Part: 2 
    Chapter: Phandalin
    Encounter: Overview
    Description: |
      For DM
      The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same ore horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.
      In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.
    Details: |
      The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.
      As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

        Sildar seems much more at ease.
        My friends,” he says, "let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint.”


      Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, larno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the “Townmaster's Hall” section). up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the “Townmaster's Hall” section).
      During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the “Town Description”section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.

      Some locales the characters should visit include the following:
      - Barthen's Provisions. If the characters have the wagon load of supplies from the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.
      - Lionshield Coster. If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.
      - Stonehill Inn. If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.

  Part 2.0.3 Encounters in Phandalin:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Encounters in Phandalin
      When the characters explore Phandalin, you don't need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you're directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.
      To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, “There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?” When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.

  2.0.3 Stonehill Inn:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The Stonehill Inn, If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are “pointers” who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.

  2.0.3 Redbrand Ruffians:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Redbrand Ruffians sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the “Redbrand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.

  2.0.3 Finding Cragmaw Castle:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Finding Cragmaw Castle. The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands. and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.

  2.0.3 Roleplaying Phandalin NPCs:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If you're not sure how to run an NPC, a good way to start is to have the character introduce himself or herself, welcome the adventurers to Phandalin, and ask who they are and what they want. You don't need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here's some advice:
      • Relax. Don't worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).
      • Get inside the NPCs' minds. Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.
      • Mug it up. Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together—what- ever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.
      • Try different voices. Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.
      • Keep the game moving. Let the players steer the inter- actions with the NPCs.

  2.0.3 Town Description:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Town Description
      Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you'll have to take turns running
      each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the “Redbrand Ruffians” encounter potentially more dangerous.
      The following sections detail specific locations in town.

  2.1.0 Stonehill Inn:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      ""In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.""

      This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see “Food, Drink, and Lodging” in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)
      The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered
      a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.
      Rumors. 
      Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include:
      • Narth, an old farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.” (See the “Shrine of Luck” section for more information.)
      • Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.” (See the “Edermath Orchard” section for more information.)
      • Lanar, a miner: “Ore raiders have been seen on the
      east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.” (See the “Townmaster's Hall” section for more information.)
      • Trilena, the innkeeper's wife: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too.” (Unknown  to Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took
      Thel's wife and children to their secret hideout.)
      • Pip, Toblen's young son: “Qelline Alderleafs son
      Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.” (See the “Alderleaf Farm” section for more information.)
      • Freda, a weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange. They don't want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.” (See the “Phandalin Miner's Exchange” section for more information.)

      These leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town—and that the ruffians are trouble.


  2.2.0 Barthen's Provisions:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Barthen's is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more
      than 25 gp. (For prices, see “Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directedtotheLionshieldCoster(seethatsection).
      The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn't around.
      DeliveringtheSupplies. Ifthecharactersbeganplay with the “Meet Me in Phandalin” adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen's. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If
      the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn't already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the “Background” section at the start of the adventure.
      Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return “any day now” to resupply. What Barthen doesn't know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See part 4, the “Wave Echo Cave” section, for more information.
      Barthen fs News. If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters seem of a mind to do something about
      it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.

  2.3.0 Edermath Orchard:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.
      Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.
      Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the “Tresendar Manor” section for more information.)
      Quest:OldOwlTrouble. Daranhasheardstories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeastofPhandalin,andfindoutwho'sthereand what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see “Old Owl Well” (page 29).
      Joining the Order of the Gauntlet
      If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character agrees, Daran awards the person the title of Chevall.


  2.4.0 Lionshield Coster:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.
      This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.) 
      The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.
      In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see “Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.
      Recovered Goods. If the characters return the stolen goods found in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.


  2.5.0 Phandalin Miner's Exchange:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors. The exchange is a great place to meet people who
      spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton.
      In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.
      Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.
      Quest: Halia'sJob Offer. If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians
      loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader's quarters. Halia doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 1 5 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.

  2.6.0 Joining the Zhentarim:
    Type: Narrative
    Description: |
      If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Zhentarim. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim's pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of Fang.
